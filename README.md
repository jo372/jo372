### About Me
---
I took an apprenticeship in Software Development (Web) and from there I decided to continue my studies and started to pursue a career in Software Engineering. Currently I am a second-year university student, who's always looking to improve their skills and expand their knowledge. I am not 100% sure where I would like to specialize and hope soon to start a blog soon to detail the things I've learnt along the way.

One of my proudest achievements last year was working alongside [AlmasB](https://github.com/AlmasB/) on his Game Engine's [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) Networking Code which can found [here](https://github.com/jo372/FXGL/tree/dev/fxgl-net/src/main/java/com/almasb/fxgl/net)
