### About Me
---
I took an apprenticeship in Software Development (Web) and from there I decided to continue my studies and started to pursue a career in Software Engineering. Currently, I am a third-year university student, who's always looking to improve their skills and expand their knowledge. I am not 100% sure where I would like to specialize and hope soon to start a blog to detail the things I've learnt along the way.

One of my proudest achievements last year was working alongside [AlmasB](https://github.com/AlmasB/) on his Game Engine's [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) Networking Code which can found [here](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/tree/dev/fxgl-io/src/main/java/com/almasb/fxgl/net)

### Currently Learning
---
* JavaFX 
* Android Application Development. 
* C & C++
* Assembly Code

Currently a work in progress: https://jordanohara.dev/ I also hope to be writing more articles after I finish university at https://hashnode.com/@jordanohara
