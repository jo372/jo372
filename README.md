### About Me
---
At NakedEnergy, I serve as a FullStack Engineer, I work alongside my team to help deliver fast, reliable, and secure applications with excellent user experiences. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies such as Django, React, Redux, TypeScript, and SCSS/LESS, I'm committed to exceeding expectations with every project.

I hold a First Class Honours degree in Software Engineering and am actively pursuing a Masters in Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity. I believe in the power of effective communication within teams and thrive on engaging with customers and colleagues to deliver high-quality services. With an aptitude for quickly acquiring new skills and adaptability, I've developed a broad skill set through diverse work experiences and academic endeavours, always eager to learn and progress.

One of my proudest achievements was working alongside [AlmasB](https://github.com/AlmasB/) on his Game Engine's [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) Networking Code which can found [here](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/tree/dev/fxgl-io/src/main/java/com/almasb/fxgl/net)
